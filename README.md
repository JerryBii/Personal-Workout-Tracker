# Personal-Workout-Tracker
An experiment with XlsxWriter to create and update spreadsheets with workout info. 

The project was supposed to be entirely for pesonal use and thus the file paths are my own.
As such the project is not funtional in it's current state.

Uses a menu system with branching options in the console to allow for spreadsheet updates and creation
